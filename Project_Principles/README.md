- [Do no Harm](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/anatomy-of-error)

- Data science is about solving problems [human-in-the-loop], not models or algorithms.

- All validation of data, hypotheses and performance should be tracked and properly peer-reviewed.

- A product needs a definition-of-done to evaluate its quality.

- Research must be broken down into clearly defined tasks. The smallest of iterations should be preferred in acquiring, integrating and correcting knowledge.

- Donâ€™t neglect assumptions in models. Make them explicit then aim to have them either verified or removed.
